## Author Profile

I am mostly interested in the development and deployment of software
for applied scientific applications. I am also interested in numerical
algorithms for solving partial differential equations and using and
developing more general scientific computing tools. My expertise is
primarily in working with python, python/C interfaces and numerical
tool kits such as Numpy, Scipy and Trilinos in high performance
computing environments. I am one of the lead developers of the
[FiPy](http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy) open-source PDE solver.
