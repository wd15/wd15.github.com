## Author Profile

I am interested in the development and deployment of software for
applied scientific applications. I have a comprehensive knowledge of
numerical algorithms for solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
as well as extensive experience in using and developing more general
scientific computing tools. I have worked with Python, C, Fortran and
Python/C interfaces and general numerical tool kits for over a
decade. I am currently working on web development for scientific
applications. I am one of the lead developers of the
[FiPy](http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy) open-source PDE solver and the
[PyMKS](http://pymks.org) materials informatics toolkit.
