I really enjoyed the Scipy 2013 conference. The talk seemed to go
quite well and there were a few interesting questions. One of the
questions involved the accessibility of Sumatra provenance data from
within a Python session and whether users need to use the web
interface. Using the web interface is not necessary and due to time
management issues, I had to rush through the IPython notebooks that
highlighted extracting simulation provenance data during a Python
session so this may not have been entirely clear from the talk.

The following movie shows "Using Sumatra to Manage Numerical
Simulations", Scipy 2013, June 25th, 2013.

Some of the embedded pages in the talk were running from a local
server when this was presented so won't be available in the
