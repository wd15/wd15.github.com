[The HTML slides](/html/intel.html) from a talk I gave for Intel representatives (Scott
List and Stephen Cea) that visited NIST on June 20th, 2013.

Use the left and right arrows to scroll through the slides. The html
may require loading a few times before the equations render
correctly. You may also need to use Chrome to view the slides.

[Git repository for the slides at the commit](https://github.com/wd15/intel/tree/c0944dc7853848927bf97ff0c5ae7285d1e1296d)
when the talk was given (c0944d).
